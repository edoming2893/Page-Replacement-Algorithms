Programming Assingment 3


The following code is a c++ code when the code is executed it will prompt the user with two options:

1) To run the program in Default Mode this mode includes the desired run as stated in the pdf instruction file. It will run all three algorithms 30x each with page frame numbers form 0 to 30. It will then output the results in a text file called "Algorithm-Results.txt" which was used to produce the graph in the report.

2) allows the user to choose the number of page frames and it will run it once for each algorithm and display the results in the screen. The user will prompted if they would like to try again and so on.


NOTE: The code was able to run in several computers using c++ compiler.  However when I tried to run the program in zeus and eros I was unable to get it completely running. There was an error at run time due to undefined behavior. Specifically array access in the Optimal Algorithm. I was unable to  find a solution to the bug. If the program is executed in your personal computer it should work.
